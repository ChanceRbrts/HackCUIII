This proof of concept that may eventually be turned into a game was made for HackCU III.

The idea is that one person is playing a game where they have to escape some room or fulfill some other objective. They can wander around, mess with objects, and do stuff.

However, they are very likely to fail.

That's where the second player, the observer, comes in. They can look around the room, searching items and figuring out what everything does. They can see some things that the player cannot see as well. The only thing that connects the player and the observer is a log that the observer can type into to give the player some information.

The Player's Controls:

Left/Right/Up/Down or WASD for movement.
E or Enter for interaction/dropping an item from your inventory
Q or Space to open up the inventory.

The Observer's Controls:
Arrow Keys or WASD to look around the room.
The mouse to select an object or the typing bar.
The keys while on the typing bar to type a message to the player; Sent when hitting Enter.

This project uses Processing, which is a library for Java that allows you to do sketches and interactive sketches. (Although Processing calls itself a language, it really is just Java.) I have had a ton of experience in Processing before, but I had never messed around with the server capabilities of Processing before. 

Learning: I learned how to use servers and clients to communicate between two processes within Processing's network library. I had messed with servers a little bit with Unity, but I never actually wrote a Server/Client system until this point. Even then, there's still some stuff that I could've done better. (Having it so two clients communicate with each other on one server, rather than what I've done: Having each process have both a server and a client to the other server.)

Completion: This is pretty much at a proof of concept level currently, since 24 hours apparently isn't enough to create a full demo of this idea. However, for the purposes of a proof of concept, and for building the entire thing in 24 hours, it works wonderfully well!

Design: Hopefully, the controls are pretty simple? The objects are still blocks, though...
